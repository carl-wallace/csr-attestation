# Notes

Motion to change group direction; put Attestation Statement Format on hold in the short-term and focus on an Internet-Draft defining putting Key Attestations into CSRs. After we have an I-D, then we can return to debating a vendor-agnostic key attestation statement format. Carl notes (on list) that CSR Attr work should be done in LAMPS, while attestation statement work should be done in RATS.

There we no strong supporters, but also no objections, so the motion carried.

draft-stjohns-csr-attest is the defacto working draft.

We spent the meeting going through MSJ's ASN.1 for CSR attributes (attached in the file 2023-05-22-msj.isn). MikeO to send a summary email of what we agreed to, see below.

The general model we envision in the short-term for the CSR attribute is that a CA should be able to "forklift out" a proprietary key attestation blob and hand it to a command-line utility provided by a vendor that will validate the attestation and return the subject public key for comparison against the CSR.

 For that, we need:
- a CSR attribute OID announcing that it carries a key attestation; for example register id-at-attestForCSR
- The attr boils down to a Type and Value field so that existing vendors can define their own OID and format (most will likely choose OCTET STRING).
- This document should define structures for common non-proprietary types such as TPM and WebAuthn.
    - MSJ wants to define the ASN.1 for this directly in this document rather than waste bytes on an OCTET STRING wrapper.
    - The group is ok with that, providing that doesn't slow down implementability of the HSM <-> CA stuff. IE let's agree to everything up until the Type & Value structure, then we can put in the I-D and ask for early OID assignment, then we don't really care if this draft gets bogged down with TPM and WebAuthn debates.

The main structures are as follows -- unmodified from previous on-list discussions (see <github>\meetingNotes\2023-05-22-msj.asn for the full ASN.1 module):

```
-- The attribute body
-- only one per CSR?  May actally make sense to have multiple different attestation paths
-- and have the CA pick the one(s) it wants.  If so, then delete COUNTS MAX below.
-- Alternately simply: attestAttribute ::= Attribute
 
attestAttribute ATTRIBUTE ::= {
        TYPE AttestStatement
        COUNTS MAX 1 
        IDENTIFIED BY id-at-attestForCSR
    }
 

-- A sequence of certificates used to validate the attestation chain.  By
-- convention, the first certificate in the chain is the one that contains
-- the attestation public key.
attestCertsAttribute ATTRIBUTE ::= {
        TYPE SEQUENCE OF CertificateChoice
        COUNTS MAX 1
        IDENTIFIED BY id-at-attestChainCerts
    }

CertificateChoice ::=
        CHOICE {
               cert Certificate, -- typical X.509 cert
       --        opaqueCert [0] IMPLICIT OCTET STRING, -- an opaque cert who's type  known implicitly to the responder
               typedCert [1] IMPLICIT TypedCert, -- a typed  cert diff from X.509 but ASN1 parseable
               typedFlatCert [2] IMPLICIT TypedFlatCert -- typed cert that does not follow ASN1
        }

 -- Defns of TypedCert, TypedFlatCert omitted for brevity, see full module.


 ATTEST-STATEMENT ::= CLASS {
&id                 OBJECT IDENTIFIER UNIQUE,
&Type,                  -- NOT optional
&algidPresent       ParamOptions DEFAULT present,
&sigPresent         ParamOptions DEFAULT present,
&ancillaryPresent   ParamOptions DEFAULT present,
  -- &sigType            SignatureChoice DEFAULT OCTET STRING
&sigType DEFAULT OCTET STRING -- 

} WITH SYNTAX {
  TYPE  &Type
  IDENTIFIED BY &id
  [ALGID IS &algidPresent]
  [SIGNATURE [TYPE &sigType] IS &sigPresent]
  [ANCILLARY IS %ancillaryPresent]
}
 

-- algId, signature are OPTIONAL to allow for opaque key attestation statements that already include the signature.
-- ancillaryData is to accommodate TPM / WebAuthn statements that wish to be "unrolled" rather than bundle itself into an opaque octet string.
AttestStatement { ATTEST-STATEMENT:IOSet}  ::= SEQUENCE
  {
    type          ATTEST-STATEMENT.&id({IOSet}),
    value         ATTEST-STATEMENT.&Type({IOSet}{@type}),
    algId         [0] IMPLICIT  AlgorithmIdentifier OPTIONAL,
    signature     [1] ATTEST-STATEMENT.&sigType OPTIONAL -- NOT implicit
    ancillaryData [2] IMPLICIT  OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
  }
```


# Email summary

Today we agreed to a slight change in direction for this group: 
We will pause working on a vendor-agnostic key attestation format and focus first on defining a CSR attribute that allows key attestations that exist today 
Yes Russ, this draft is mean to include and replace draft-ietf-lamps-key-attestation-ext.


# Next Steps

* ACTION: MSJ and MikeO to update draft-stjohns-csr-attest to match -- mainly means adding the ASN.1 module and tweaking some of the text with short-term and long-term goals of this draft.
