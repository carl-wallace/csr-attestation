CSR Attest

- TCG has now published a table with OID values. Monty will update the table in 6.4.2 to link to the new document.
- Mike is now busy with PQ drafts, and has asked Hannes, Henk, Monty, Ned (co-authors) to help drive this over the line. Things to do:
   - Work with Hannes to sort out the 4 open PRs about the Hint; merge the good one and close the others.

   - Do a pass over the open issues -- are there any remaining that are critical to address before WGLC / RFC publication, or should we just close them out?
